<h1>42 LIBFT</h1>
<br>
<p>This repo is a library of functions made in C where most of them are replicas of standard libc, some are sugestions and others are my own idea</p>
<p>As it is part of 42cursus the functions writing follows rules stabilished by the Norme V3 of Ã‰cole 42</p>
<p>If you found this repo because you're also a 42 student (or a science computer student at all), feel free to look at this repo for your reference, but keep in mind that to be a good programmer you must be able to code your own functions</p>
